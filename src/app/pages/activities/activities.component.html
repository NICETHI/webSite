  <h1>Current Activities:</h1>
  <h2>Tandem Pairs:</h2>
  <p class="mx-2">
    We would map 2 people who could improve their language knowledge by
    interchangeably sharing.
  </p>
  <h2>Tandem Families:</h2>
  <p class="mx-2">
    We would map a group of 4-6 people of the same language level. Our
    motivation to do this activity is that students could help each other with
    the techniques that they found useful while they are practising the language
    and to build a small community around language.
  </p>
  <h2>Tandem Meets:</h2>
  <p class="mx-2">
    We are going to continue with an online format for at least the first part
    of the semester. We are determined to do the meetings in real life again as
    soon as possible, of course when the situation gets better and also if you
    are interested!
  </p>
  <h2>Tandem Acts:</h2>
  <p class="mx-2">
    We want to start this activity the next semester. In this activity, we would
    group all the students who are learning a particular language. The students
    from this group could make a team of 4-6 people and write a script and/or
    make a short film of up to 4-8 minutes on the topic that you like...but the
    specific details would be shared with you after you enrol. There would be a
    contest and the winners would get a certificate and a worthy prize.
